- need script to kill ruby jekyll hosting (or I should the learn the proper command to quit)
- I should add a script to unmute on fullscreen in the animations section! Also need a script to kill local runs of this blog. Also should sort videos by date in sports section
- Add an about page (doesn't have to be too long, this whole blog is an about blog really)
- try pulling data using google api to check for most recent youtube video on my blog https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels/list
- add a page for all the books ive read and my thoughts on them
