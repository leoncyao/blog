&lt;!-- 

Last week I tried to calculate the 'small arc' invariant for some capped trivial tangles, but i misunderstand what makes the invariant small. I thought small meant that the last part of the chain dissapears, but I only need to count the number of vertices. 

So far I know that the immersed curve invariant corresponds some set of curves on the $4$ punctured disk.  
It turns out that adding positive or negative twists to the ends of the tangle corresponds to switching the punctures on the $4$ punctured disk, which in turns simplifies the tangle. I am tasked with calculating the small arc for different rational tangles, and experimenting to see how different twists affect the invariant. (The invariant is unique up to these kinds of twists). 

I am also tasked with categorizing the capped trivial tangles into families. So far I know of 3 families. 

The first family comes from the quotient of the trefoil knot. 
&lt;img src = &quot;/blog//assets/img/7-15-2020-1.jpg&quot;&gt; 
For each $n &gt; 0$, we can twists the designated strands to get a different tangle, and each of these tangles correspond to the quotient tangle of a torus knot. So far it seems that the nth tangle corresponds to the nth torus knot, though I still need to verify some more examples for higher $n$. I wonder how I would prove this? I would need to show the twists on the torus correspond to the n twists on the designated strands. 

The second family from surgery on the first family. I am not sure how exactly it is done, but we can take the designated strand and &quot;wrap&quot; it around the the top band. The case $m = 1$ is shown on the right.
&lt;img src = &quot;/blog//assets/img/7-15-2020-2.jpg&quot;&gt; 

The third family comes surgery on the second family. For fixed $n, m$, we can let $k$ be some intger, and add $k$ twists inside the rectange (positive means positively sloped twists, negative is negatively sloped twists). 
&lt;img src = &quot;/blog//assets/img/7-15-2020-3.jpg&quot;&gt; 

I should be able to categorize all of the quotient tangles I have found so far with 5 crossings or less in these 3 families. From 5 crossings onward, I will hopefully find some more interesting families.   --&gt;</content><author><name>Leon Yao</name></author><summary type="html">This week I am still trying to categorize capped trivial tangles into families.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Immersed Curve Invariant</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/ImmersedCurveInvariant" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Immersed Curve Invariant" /><published>2019-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/ImmersedCurveInvariant</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/ImmersedCurveInvariant">&lt;p&gt;I talked with Ben Garbuz today and he taught me a bit about the Immersed Curve Invariant and how it’s related to Khovanov homology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a 4 ended tangle, we will designate each of the 4 ends to become part of a boundary of a 3 punctured disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, given the rational tangle with 1 negative twist, we would transform the tangle into the following diagram&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/ImmersedCurveInvariant/ImmersedCurveInvariant-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then stretch the strand of tangle that does not have a star end point, such that so the end points of the red curve on the punctures correspond to the endpoints of the tangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will label the diagram will the following symbols, so that we can represent the homotopy class of the curve in a simpler way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/ImmersedCurveInvariant/ImmersedCurveInvariant-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, we can construct the chain complex over the ring generated by the $S, D$ cobordisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been told that we assume the curve always has a counterclockwise orientation, but it doesn’t match up with the program…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this by splitting the curve up into whenever it touches one of the dark green lines. The above curve would have 3 sections.
For every section that doesn’t go into puncture, we will label it by S or D, depending on which of the S, D directions it follows on the boundary. From there, we construct the chain complex by with chain groups represented by the black or white dots, and boundary operators labelled with S and D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above curve would have chain complex&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/ImmersedCurveInvariant/ImmersedCurveInvariant-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curve can be used to calculate Khovanov Homology of the numerator closure of the tangle in the following way. For unreduced Khovanov homology, we draw the following orange curve. We then inspect the intersections between the red tangle curve and the orange curve. The number of intersections tells us how many copies of $\mathbb{F}$ there are in the homology. So here there would be 5 copies (This seems wrong, I think Ben told me you need to draw it in the minimal form, but I am not sure how to do that)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/ImmersedCurveInvariant/ImmersedCurveInvariant-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, there is a process upon where you first assign gradings to the intersections between the orange curve and the dark straight lines, and then from there you can follow the orange curve to find the gradings of the groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Leon Yao</name></author><summary type="html">I talked with Ben Garbuz today and he taught me a bit about the Immersed Curve Invariant and how it’s related to Khovanov homology.
