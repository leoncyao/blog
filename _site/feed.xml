The contest consisted of a bunch of questions of the form “is N over 9000”, where $n$ was given by some complicated expression. We didn’t do too well xD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought some of the rules and questions were interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog///assets/Images/Over9000rules.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend and I were initially aiming to get every question wrong, as the hosts had the rule that since every question boiled down to true or false, they would take the top 4 teams with highest absolute value score. Unofrtunately we consistently alternate between getting questions correct and getting questions wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog///assets/Images/Over9000question.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last question was game theory related, as the value of N would be 9001 if there were an odd number of people who voted it was such, and 1 otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we were not allowed to collude between teams. There were an odd number of teams for this competition, so we would have all gotten the question right if we all voted that N was over 9000. Sadly it would later turn out of that some of voted under 9000, as N turned out to be 1, meaning that there were an even number of people who voted under 9000. Perhaps because they wanted to score higher than the other teams.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Leon Yao</name></author><summary type="html">I competed in a math contest today called “Over 9000” with a friend.

I helped with some of the ideas. Was fun and tiring, as the players went in directions we did not anticipate. Also saw a lot of plotholes, its interesting to see the parts that needed more speficiation, generally crucial clues needed more details as player would make things up that weren’t exactly true, and such errors would cascade and cover up the real killers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Leon Yao</name></author><summary type="html">Made an animation for the finite element method with time dependence!

&lt;p&gt;I have some new ideas for projects, god knows if I ever finish any of them xD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Pdes heat/fluids game (ice age end of the world apocalypse where you assign heat sources in an apartment to keep people alive), planning to use ngsolve library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Text based job assignment fantasy game, planning to use gurobi to solve job assignment ip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Apply finite element method to black scholes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also looking at one of my supervisor’s papers. Yo, base golden ratio \(\phi\) number systems are cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In base \(\phi\), where \(\phi\) is the larger root of \(\phi^2 - \phi - 1 = 0\) i.e \(\phi \approx 1.618\) numbers are written \(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}{a_n\phi^{-n}}\), so it’s the normal decimal system except we have \(\phi\) instead of $10$. 
It is also similar to binary, as \(a_n\) are only allowed to be \(0\) or \(1\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the base 10 system, there are many different ways to write the same number (Infinite ways according to Erdős).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the number \(1\) in base \(10\) can be written as \(1.0, 0.11, 0.1011\) in base \(\phi\), and there are trickier expansions such as $0.110110110110 … $ and $0.10101011010$. These can be shown with a little algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt; A little algebra showing the above &lt;/summary&gt;
$$
\begin{align}
\phi^2 - \phi - 1 &amp;amp;= 0 \text{ start with quadratic equation} \\
1 - \frac{1}{\phi} - \frac{1}{\phi^2} &amp;amp;= 0 \text{ divide both sides by } \phi \\
1 &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^2} \text{ rearrange, note that this would be } 0.11 \text{ in base } \phi  \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{\frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^2}}{\phi^2} \text{ sub in previous line for the 1 in the numerator of }\frac{1}{\phi^4} \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^3} + \frac{1}{\phi^4} \text{simplify, note that this would be } 0.1011 \text{ in base } \phi \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^3} + \frac{\frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^2} }{\phi^4} \text{ repeat substitution process always on the greatest power term}
 \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^3} + \frac{1}{\phi^5} + \frac{1}{\phi^6} \\
  &amp;amp; \vdots 
\end{align} 
$$
which then becomes $$0.10101010...$$ in base $\phi$.
Other expansions such as $$0.110110110...$$ can be shown with a similar method, though you would replace the $1$ with $\frac{1}{\phi^2} - \frac{1}{\phi}$ in a different term (not always the greatest power one).
