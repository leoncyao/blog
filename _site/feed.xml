I helped with some of the ideas. Was fun and tiring, as the players went in directions we did not anticipate. Also saw a lot of plotholes, its interesting to see the parts that needed more speficiation, generally crucial clues needed more details as player would make things up that weren’t exactly true, and such errors would cascade and cover up the real killers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Leon Yao</name></author><summary type="html">Made an animation for the finite element method with time dependence!

&lt;p&gt;I have some new ideas for projects, god knows if I ever finish any of them xD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Pdes heat/fluids game (ice age end of the world apocalypse where you assign heat sources in an apartment to keep people alive), planning to use ngsolve library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Text based job assignment fantasy game, planning to use gurobi to solve job assignment ip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Apply finite element method to black scholes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also looking at one of my supervisor’s papers. Yo, base golden ratio &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\phi&lt;/script&gt; number systems are cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In base &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\phi&lt;/script&gt;, where &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\phi&lt;/script&gt; is the larger root of &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\phi^2 - \phi - 1 = 0&lt;/script&gt; i.e &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\phi \approx 1.618&lt;/script&gt; numbers are written &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}{a_n\phi^{-n}}&lt;/script&gt;, so it’s the normal decimal system except we have &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\phi&lt;/script&gt; instead of $10$. 
It is also similar to binary, as &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;a_n&lt;/script&gt; are only allowed to be &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0&lt;/script&gt; or &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the base 10 system, there are many different ways to write the same number (Infinite ways according to Erdős).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the number &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; in base &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;10&lt;/script&gt; can be written as &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1.0, 0.11, 0.1011&lt;/script&gt; in base &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\phi&lt;/script&gt;, and there are trickier expansions such as $0.110110110110 … $ and $0.10101011010$. These can be shown with a little algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt; A little algebra showing the above &lt;/summary&gt;
$$
\begin{align}
\phi^2 - \phi - 1 &amp;amp;= 0 \text{ start with quadratic equation} \\
1 - \frac{1}{\phi} - \frac{1}{\phi^2} &amp;amp;= 0 \text{ divide both sides by } \phi \\
1 &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^2} \text{ rearrange, note that this would be } 0.11 \text{ in base } \phi  \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{\frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^2}}{\phi^2} \text{ sub in previous line for the 1 in the numerator of }\frac{1}{\phi^4} \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^3} + \frac{1}{\phi^4} \text{simplify, note that this would be } 0.1011 \text{ in base } \phi \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^3} + \frac{\frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^2} }{\phi^4} \text{ repeat substitution process always on the greatest power term}
 \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{\phi} + \frac{1}{\phi^3} + \frac{1}{\phi^5} + \frac{1}{\phi^6} \\
  &amp;amp; \vdots 
\end{align} 
$$
which then becomes $$0.10101010...$$ in base $\phi$.
Other expansions such as $$0.110110110...$$ can be shown with a similar method, though you would replace the $1$ with $\frac{1}{\phi^2} - \frac{1}{\phi}$ in a different term (not always the greatest power one).
