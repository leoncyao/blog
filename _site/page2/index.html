    I competed in a math contest today called "Over 9000" with a friend. The contest consisted of a bunch of questions of the form "is N over 9000", where $n$ was given by some complicated expression. We didn't do too well xD.

I thought some of the rules and questions were interesting. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}//assets/Images/Over9000rules.jpg">

My friend and I were initially aiming to get every question wrong, as the hosts had the rule that since every question boiled down to true or false, they would take the top 4 teams with highest absolute value score. Unofrtunately we consistently alternate between getting questions correct and getting questions wrong. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}//assets/Images/Over9000question.jpg">

The last question was game theory related, as the value of N would be 9001 if there were an odd number of people who voted it was such, and 1 otherwise. 

Unfortunately, we were not allowed to collude between teams. There were an odd number of teams for this competition, so we would have all gotten the question right if we all voted that N was over 9000. Sadly it would later turn out of that some of voted under 9000, as N turned out to be 1, meaning that there were an even number of people who voted under 9000. Perhaps because they wanted to score higher than the other teams.

    Wanted to go see a jazz show tonight but unfortunately the tickets were sold out. Luckily, there were some buskers on the street. The band was called "Just Fine", and they were a really R&B band.

It also looks cool when you plot it out with time as the third dimension (Thanks Leonidas for the suggestion).

I then varied the initial condition. <br>It starts at $u(x, 0) = \sin(0x)$ and ends up at $\sin(5\pi x)$ over the duration of the video.

Auto covid form completer seems to work with schtasks, though it seems my computer needs to be on for it to run. Hopefully, I can run it in the background with some permissions, so I can leave my computer asleep

Helped my friend with a halloween murder mystery party script.
I helped with some of the ideas. Was fun and tiring, as the players went in directions we did not anticipate. Also saw a lot of plotholes, its interesting to see the parts that needed more speficiation, generally crucial clues needed more details as player would make things up that weren’t exactly true, and such errors would cascade and cover up the real killers.

    Halfway through reading week.

Today I worked on a possible research project, specifically the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/pages/Research#chebyshev_optimization">Integer Chebyshev Problem</a>, which I think is a cool optimzation problem. It'll be interesting to see if they are any real world applications.

I'm trying to get the <a href="https://github.com/leoncyao/autofill_covid_self_assesment">js script</a> I wrote last week to automatically run once every day, but I don't like using Windows Automatic Scheduler. Hopefully I can find a better script automater.
