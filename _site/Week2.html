  <p>This week I had some freedom to try different things.</p>

<p>I plan to host a mini conference for UBC NSERC and WLI participants online. 
So far half the participants have responded to my survey, and most of them are interested 
in a mini-conference. It’ll definitely be interesting to host on zoom. I need to be very careful as I know zoom has some unexpected bugs.</p>

<p>I was thinking that it would be interesting to see if there are any patterns between colourability and the different polynomials I’ve learned.
I think I would be able to write Knot Colouring as an Integer program, as it is similar enough to graph colouring. 
I obtained a Gurobi Academic license (Gurobi is an integer program solver), and I will try to see if my integer programs 
give me the correct results on different chromatic numbers for knots.</p>

<p>I’ve still be reading Dror Bar Natan’s paper on computing Khovanov Homology. It’s been slow, but I am making some progress. I wonder if I can think of 
the two vector spaces associated with each cycle in terms of electric charge. Then, when we merge or break cycles, do the maps correspond to cancelling or creating charge?</p>

<p>I’ve also been reviewing topology. I read the section in the Knot book corresponding to Knot complements. 
They don’t say much about it, but I learned some new topological facts (which I was not expecting to). 
I never realized that homeomorphisms let you cut and glue manifolds, as long as the gluing is consistent.</p>

<p>I think it’s because you can go from the 3D representation to the 2D square with sides identified, and then shift the parts of the square 
so that when you go back to 3D, the torus becomes twisted. I need to read more about this.</p>
