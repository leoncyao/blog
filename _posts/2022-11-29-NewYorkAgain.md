Went to New York to see some friends. Unfortunately they weren't able to see me with their eyes shut.

Saw Hasan Minaj at Red Bank. Learned what Roth IRA was after some crowd work where Hasan made fun of a kid for flexing about having one https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp.

Watched the Chicago Musical at the Ambassador theatre! Was pretty good, lovely music, interesting to watch the musical from the balcony, but watching downwards for that long is hard on the neck.
