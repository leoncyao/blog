Busy Summer so far. What are some highlights?

Going to see Josh Johnson, Stray kids, John Mulaney later.

Saw Taylor Tomilison and Jimmy Yang recently, both pretty good.
Taylor talked a lot about religion, I wish I knew more bible stories so I could understand the jokes

Jimmy's jokes were all about asian stereotypes. Still pretty funny. 

Going back to Vancouver week of July 21. It's been a year. Hope to see highschool friends. Maybe I should do a day trip to Seattle. 

Band has been playing at a bunch of places this year. Something like 6 shows? We are playing at Tranzac this Sunday for the second time. Need to recruit a pianist, Harley and Asic are leaving (but we will meet again). Happy that we got a violnist and a guitarist.

Trying to learn boxing, bought a punching bag, and friends gave me boxing gloves for my birthday. Still doing fencing, should get a new set of FIE equipment and compete. 

Did some rotoscoping recently.

Also remade the linkedin bot with pychrome instead of selenium. Cursor is pretty useful indeed. Unfortunately linkedin put in a limit of 50 easy apply job apps per day. Time to move onto indeed i guess.

In hart house Jazz band as well this summer, playing Whirlybird and the mario theme!!! 

Will try to learn tennis with elly and asic, and bouldering with mae and jennie
