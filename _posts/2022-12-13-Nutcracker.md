Saw the Nutcracker Ballet with my roommate!

Planning to go to China this Sunday (very spontaenous)

Was originally going to next february but changed my mind (since laid off)

Been busking a lot in the subways recently. Make about 20 dollars an hour. 
I wonder if I could have been a professional musician, and not have been homeless.
