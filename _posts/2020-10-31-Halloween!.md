Made an animation for the finite element method with time dependence!

It also looks cool when you plot it out with time as the third dimension (Thanks leonidas for the suggestion).

Auto covid form completer seems to work with schtasks, though it seems my computer needs to be on for it to run. Hopefully, I can run it in the background with some permissions, so I can leave my computer asleep

Helped my friend with a halloween murder mystery party script.
I helped with some of the ideas. Was fun and tiring, as the players went in directions we did not anticipate. Also saw a lot of plotholes, its interesting to see the parts that needed more speficiation, generally crucial clues needed more details as player would make things up that werenâ€™t exactly true, and such errors would cascade and cover up the real killers.
