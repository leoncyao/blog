My friend said she would give me 1000 dollars if I could get a date with this pfp.


I wrote this for the bio:

My friend bet me 1000$ I couldn't get a date with this pfp, which also happens to be the amount I'd be willing to spend on our first date.

Sorry, it's 200$ now, she got scared I might win.

I didn't follow through though, I started feeling bad because I thought I was leading girls on, and also I don't think I need a dating app to meet people (currently meeting so many people that when I get a message I can't remember who the person is xD)
