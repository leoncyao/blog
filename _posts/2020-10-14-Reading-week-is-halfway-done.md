Halfway through reading week.

Today I worked on a possible research project, specifically the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/pages/Projects#chebyshev_optimization">Integer Chebyshev Problem</a>, which I think is a cool optimzation problem. It'll be interesting to see if they are any real world applications.

I'm trying to get the js script I wrote last week to automatically run once every day, but I don't like using Windows Automatic Scheduler. Hopefully I can find a better script automater.
