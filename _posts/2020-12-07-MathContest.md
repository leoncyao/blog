I competed in a math contest today called "Over 9000" with a friend. The contest consisted of a bunch of questions of the form "is N over 9000", where $n$ was given by some complicated expression. We didn't do too well xD.

I thought some of the rules and questions were interesting.

My friend and I were initially aiming to get every question wrong, as the hosts had the rule that since every question boiled down to true or false, they would take the top 4 teams with highest absolute value score. Unofrtunately we consistently alternate between getting questions correct and getting questions wrong.

The last question was game theory related, as the value of N would be 9001 if there were an odd number of people who voted it was such, and 1 otherwise. 

Unfortunately, we were not allowed to collude between teams. There were an odd number of teams for this competition, so we would have all gotten the question right if we all voted that N was over 9000. Sadly it would later turn out of that some of voted under 9000, as N turned out to be 1, meaning that there were an even number of people who voted under 9000. Perhaps because they wanted to score higher than the other teams.
