Started a part time job doing software dev for my friends startup called Directr. 
Trying to get an indeed bot to work.
Made 50 dollars busking yesterday


I was thinking why I like swing dance and kpop dance so much.

I think the choreography in kpop dance in similar to big band. Members dance in sync according to the "melody" but also add their own flourishes. I like the asymmetry in monster and growl, as members get their solo, even controlling other members.

Swing dance is more like jazz combo music, very improvised.
