Summary of Week 1: 
It was definitely the calm before the storm this week. I mainly read up on Knot Theory and attended online lectures. I have started reading Dror Bar-Natan's paper and it is interesting but difficult (Why is it called height if we draw the diagram sideways from left to right ahhhh).
