<!-- If you look at the definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_complex#Definitions">Chain Complex </a> you will see a lot of scary words like "differential" and "cochain". 

I want to try and motivate the usefulness of Chain Complexes without using any of those hard words.  -->

Let's begin with some geometry. Take a piece of paper. Roll it up into a cylinder by gluing along an edge. Then fold the ends into a doughnut shape by gluing along a circle. 

Here is a hard question to answer. Is there a way to deform the doughnut back into the flat piece of paper with using scissors?

If you try it yourself you would probably guess not. One of the things you might say is a problem is that the donut has this hole in the middle.
