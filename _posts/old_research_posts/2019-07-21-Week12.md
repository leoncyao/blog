This week I am still trying to categorize capped trivial tangles into families.


<!-- 

Last week I tried to calculate the 'small arc' invariant for some capped trivial tangles, but i misunderstand what makes the invariant small. I thought small meant that the last part of the chain dissapears, but I only need to count the number of vertices. 

So far I know that the immersed curve invariant corresponds some set of curves on the $4$ punctured disk.  
It turns out that adding positive or negative twists to the ends of the tangle corresponds to switching the punctures on the $4$ punctured disk, which in turns simplifies the tangle. I am tasked with calculating the small arc for different rational tangles, and experimenting to see how different twists affect the invariant. (The invariant is unique up to these kinds of twists). 

I am also tasked with categorizing the capped trivial tangles into families. So far I know of 3 families. 

The first family comes from the quotient of the trefoil knot.

For each $n > 0$, we can twists the designated strands to get a different tangle, and each of these tangles correspond to the quotient tangle of a torus knot. So far it seems that the nth tangle corresponds to the nth torus knot, though I still need to verify some more examples for higher $n$. I wonder how I would prove this? I would need to show the twists on the torus correspond to the n twists on the designated strands. 

The second family from surgery on the first family. I am not sure how exactly it is done, but we can take the designated strand and "wrap" it around the the top band. The case $m = 1$ is shown on the right.

The third family comes surgery on the second family. For fixed $n, m$, we can let $k$ be some intger, and add $k$ twists inside the rectange (positive means positively sloped twists, negative is negatively sloped twists).

I should be able to categorize all of the quotient tangles I have found so far with 5 crossings or less in these 3 families. From 5 crossings onward, I will hopefully find some more interesting families.   -->
