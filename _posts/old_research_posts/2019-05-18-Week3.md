Summary of Week 3:

- Mainly read more of Dror's paper. Calculated some of Khovanov homology groups for simple knots. 

- Met up with some other NSERC participants over Zoom. Was awkward but fun! Hopefully there will be more people interested in presenting their research halfway through the summer. 

- I also drew some examples capped-trivial tangles. They are interesting to draw, though sometimes I find it difficult to see how to simplify them.
