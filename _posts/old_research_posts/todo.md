<!-- Here are some things I want to add to my site:
- organize capped trivial tangles into families

- finish rational tangle post
- finish bracket polynomial post
- finish chain complex post (this might take a while)
- make fundamental group post 
- add references for Sakuma Tangle
- add link hover text for capped trivial tangles
- Instead of having one feed for posts, split the feed into a Summary of week section and a math posts section
- Having a pop up around your mouse when you hover over a definition
- about me page
- links to other peoples cool sites
- organize images better
