title: Immersed Curve Invariant
---

I talked with Ben Garbuz today and he taught me a bit about the Immersed Curve Invariant and how it's related to Khovanov homology. 

Given a 4 ended tangle, we will designate each of the 4 ends to become part of a boundary of a 3 punctured disk. 

For example, given the rational tangle with 1 negative twist, we would transform the tangle into the following diagram

We then stretch the strand of tangle that does not have a star end point, such that so the end points of the red curve on the punctures correspond to the endpoints of the tangle. 

We will label the diagram will the following symbols, so that we can represent the homotopy class of the curve in a simpler way.

From here, we can construct the chain complex over the ring generated by the $S, D$ cobordisms. 

I have been told that we assume the curve always has a counterclockwise orientation, but it doesn't match up with the program...

We do this by splitting the curve up into whenever it touches one of the dark green lines. The above curve would have 3 sections.
For every section that doesn't go into puncture, we will label it by S or D, depending on which of the S, D directions it follows on the boundary. From there, we construct the chain complex by with chain groups represented by the black or white dots, and boundary operators labelled with S and D. 

The above curve would have chain complex

The curve can be used to calculate Khovanov Homology of the numerator closure of the tangle in the following way. For unreduced Khovanov homology, we draw the following orange curve. We then inspect the intersections between the red tangle curve and the orange curve. The number of intersections tells us how many copies of $\mathbb{F}$ there are in the homology. So here there would be 5 copies (This seems wrong, I think Ben told me you need to draw it in the minimal form, but I am not sure how to do that)

From there, there is a process upon where you first assign gradings to the intersections between the orange curve and the dark straight lines, and then from there you can follow the orange curve to find the gradings of the groups.
