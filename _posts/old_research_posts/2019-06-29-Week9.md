Last week I continued to polish tangles. I find it tricky to perform "band" R1 moves, as there are often strands that go through the band, and it is hard to visualize what happens to the band. 

This week I am tasked with using the python program to calculate Khovanov refinement for simple tangles. It is interesting to convert the drawings I've made to the format the program uses.
