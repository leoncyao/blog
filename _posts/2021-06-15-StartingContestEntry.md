Planning to enter the 3Blue1Brown summer of math contest.
I plan to work with <a href="https://igmanthony.com/fields-ions-optics/"> Professor Ian Anthony </a> to make a video explaining finite difference methods for eletric fields. He researches really cool stuff! 

Trying to learn the charmer dance, but it's super fast.
