Planning to visit Reykjavik in October. It'd be ideal if I could be friend someone in the CS program at RU, who could show me around and also tell me about how the cs program there. Not sure how to go about that. I tried to talking to their registrar, but they haven't responded to my request to a student's contact. 

If I was a incoming uoft student, how could I get a cs student's contact here without being enrolled.
