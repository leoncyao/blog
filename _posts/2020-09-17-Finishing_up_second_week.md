This week is coming to a close. Worked on my Numerical algs assignment and made a little animation for the <a class="sidebar-nav-item" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/pages/Animations#Finite_Difference_Example.mp4" style="display:inline">first question</a>
and the 2D version for the <a class="sidebar-nav-item" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/pages/Animations#Finite_Difference_Example_2D.mp4" style="display:inline">next question</a>.
