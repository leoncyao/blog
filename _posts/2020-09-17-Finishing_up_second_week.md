This week is coming to a close. Worked on my Numerical algs assignment and made a little animation for the <a class="sidebar-nav-item" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/pages/Animations#Finite_Difference_Example.mp4" style="display:inline">first question</a>
and the 2D version for the <a class="sidebar-nav-item" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/pages/Animations#Finite_Difference_Example_2D.mp4" style="display:inline">next question</a>.

The former is the Finite Difference solution to $$u''(x) = -(3 \cdot x + x^2) \cdot e^x$$ on the domain $$[0, 1]$$ with $$0$$ boundary conditions.

The latter is the Finite Difference solution to $$\delta u = -2 \cdot (x + y - x^2 - y^2)$$ on the domain $$[0, 1]^2$$ with $$0$$ boundary conditions.
