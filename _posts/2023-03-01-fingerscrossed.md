Fingers crossed on the two companies!

Someone gave me a 20 dollar bill today, and it was stolen a few minutes later. Pretty sad. Gotta remember to collect those.

I was biking to oakville along waterfront and I saw this sign.

I talked to the cashier and he told me about his recurring battle with shoplifting schoolkids. 

Super excited for my bands rehearsal / swing dance tomorrow!
