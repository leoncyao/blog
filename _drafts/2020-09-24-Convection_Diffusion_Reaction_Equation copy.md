$$ \frac{\partial{c}}{\partial{t}} = \nabla \cdot (D\nabla c ) - \lambda \cdot (\textbf{v} c) + R$$

This can be used to model the heat in a room, as shown here.

I am also reading up on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model">Black-Scholes model</a> which is used in finance. More specifically,
